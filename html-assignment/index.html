            <p>I am Mo Zhang from China. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Finance from <abbr title="Washington State University">WSU</abbr>, United States, in 2017. After graduation, I worked at two different financial companies in China. Through these experiences, I realized my interest lies in self-employment. As a result, I decided to pursue a career as a YouTuber/Vlogger, which is why I chose to study the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>.</p>
            <p><div>After the 2<sup>nd</sup> weeks of learning about design courses, I realized that there are many career options beyond being a YouTuber, such as <em>graphic designer, photographer, and web developer.</em> This has allowed me to explore new fields I had never considered before while keeping my curiosity alive. As an American writer said, <blockquote>Curiosity is the wick in the candle of learning.-<cite>William Arthur Ward</cite></blockquote>I believe that after graduation, I will discover even more career paths and opportunities.</div></p>
